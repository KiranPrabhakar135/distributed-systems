What is TCP-IP
Anyway, to answer your 9 questions directly:

1.is it a software(I think it has to be)?
Generally yes. There are implementations of the core stack in firmware on some network boards (NICs).

2.Is it a BIOS level software?
No. The core protocols generally are kernel drivers.

3.Where is the protocol set installed in a computer?(Windows,linux,mac etc..)
Generally, the core protocols are kernel-level drivers for efficiency. Some protocols such as SSH, TELNET, and FTP are dynamically loaded when needed. There is a daemon on Linux/Unix systems called inetd (or xinetd - more current) which will start the SSH, TELNET, FTP, or other servers when a connection is made by the appropriate kind of client.

4.Can we uninstall it like normal software?
Not easily. Practically all networking today is built upon the TCP/IP protocol stack.

5.Can we update it?
Yes.

6.Where do routers and modems have that tcp/ip stack(protocol set)?
Incomplete question. Trying to read into your question, most routers run some sort of embedded Linux software, and the TCP/IP stack are kernel drivers. You can configure a kernel to build the protocols out of the kernel, but then you'd effectively have no networking at all.

7.In which language is it written?
Generally in C. Linux kernels are written almost entirely in C.

8.Will we ever get an update?
Often. When drivers are updated for Windows systems, or when the kernel is updated in Linux/Unix systems.
